# Car-Price-Predication

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features like mileage, year, brand, and condition. The model was developed using Python and deployed using Streamlit for real-time interaction.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict car prices using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset containing features related to cars such as their mileage, year of manufacture, brand, and condition. After preprocessing the data, we employed various algorithms, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, to optimize the accuracy of predictions.

## Features

- **Prediction Model**: Uses machine learning to forecast car prices with an accuracy of 85%.
- **Real-Time Input**: The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input car details and get instant price predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned and prepared using Pandas and NumPy to ensure high-quality input for the model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of Random Forest, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 12%.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest
